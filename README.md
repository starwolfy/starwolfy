- Commercially release Space Frontiers on Steam, requiring all previous and upcoming players to pay a one-time fee for access to the clients. *(2028?)*
- Build the Space Frontiers community and assign (hired) people with responsbilities and high authorization to ensure the game can continue on its own in a commercial open-source environment.
- In case of success, make [Star Wolves](https://starwolves.io/) an independent commerciably viable digital empire evolved around online gaming and art.
- Contribute to freeing the world by contributing to the re-appearance of tolerant heteronormative values through the New Age movement.
