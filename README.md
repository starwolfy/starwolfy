### Personal Long-Term Goals üåü
- Do a Kickstarter for [Space Frontiers](https://github.com/starwolves/space) alpha. *(2026?)*
- Commercially release Space Frontiers on Steam, requiring all previous and upcoming players to pay a one-time fee for paid accounts. *(2028?)*
- Build the Space Frontiers community and assign (hired) people with responsbilities and high authorization to ensure the game can continue on its own in a commercial open-source environment.
- In case of success, make [Star Wolves](https://starwolves.io/) an independent commerciably viable digital empire evolved around online gaming and art.
- Let's make [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and other upcoming decentralized alternatives to communication and work tools great one day.
